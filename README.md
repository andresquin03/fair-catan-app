# 🎲 Fair Catan

Fair Catan is a 2d6 bag-based dice roller designed to reduce streaky luck in games like Catan. Instead of rolling independently every time, it draws results from a finite distribution that matches the true 2d6 probabilities (72 for example). This keeps the long-term probabilities intact while smoothing out extreme short-term variance in typical game sessions.
